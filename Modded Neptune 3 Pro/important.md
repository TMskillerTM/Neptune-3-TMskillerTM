## Take note of the following:

The 3D models as well as the configuration files are very custom, you may use them at your own risk.

- My N3P is configured to have the two z-motors to run on different stepper drivers, so the config won't work for a standard N3P.
- Probe offsets won't match with a standard N3P
- Bed mesh points won't work for a standard N3P
- Min and max positions won't work for a standard N3P
- PID values and thermistor type won't work for a standard N3P
