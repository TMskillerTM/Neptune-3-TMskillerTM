Upload them to your config and include them in your printer.cfg. 
The only things you should need to adjust are:

- Bed_screw positions depending on your exact printer model
- bed_mesh_min and bed_mesh_max depending on your exact printer model

the steps are well documented in the official Klipper documentation.
